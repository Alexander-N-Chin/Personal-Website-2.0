### What is the Aim of the Briar Ziggs Assessment?

The League of Legends (LoL) Briar Ziggs playstyle assessment is designed to help players identify and gain some understanding around how they engage with the game and make strategic decisions, reflecting their patterns of play and in-game behavior.

### Perception and Judgment in LoL

Perception and judgment in LoL describe how players prefer to engage with the game. Perception involves all the ways of becoming aware of in-game events, champion abilities, team movements, or strategic objectives. Players naturally perceive in opposite ways. Judgment involves all the ways of coming to conclusions about what has been perceived. There are also opposite ways in how players naturally make decisions.

We call these opposites preferences because most players prefer one side more than the other but can access and use both sides of a preference pair if a situation calls for it.

Perception and judgment are mental processes, mental activities or how players use their minds in-game. Differences in perception (what players see in any given situation) and judgment (what they decide to do about it) result in corresponding differences in playstyle characteristics, behaviors, interests, reactions, values, and motivations.

### Innate vs Learned Preferences in LoL

According to type theory, our playstyle preferences are innate, inborn predispositions that develop over the lifespan. Frequent use of one side of a preference pair leads to the development of certain playstyle characteristics. Although we find similar characteristics and behaviors in players with the same preferences, there are also differences.

First, playstyle does not dictate behavior; although the preferences describe behavioral attributes corresponding to those preferences, type theory recognizes that we have a choice in how we behave in-game. We can choose to act upon our natural preferences (strength) or use an opposite preference (stretch) if it is better suited to the situation.

Second, life experiences and our environment impact the development of, and how we express, our playstyle preferences. With awareness, we can learn to use the opposite preferences. They will likely never feel easy or natural, but nonetheless, we have access to them when necessary. The LoL playstyle assessment is a good tool for pointing out areas of our playstyle that we may have learned, as opposed to that which is natural.

### The LoL Playstyle Framework

The LoL playstyle framework consists of eight preferences organized into four pairs of opposites. Your LoL playstyle type represents your natural preferences in four important aspects of gameplay. We use all the preferences, but most players prefer one side of a preference pair more than the other which accounts for the natural playstyle differences between players.

### What do you prefer?

**Aggressive/Patient**
Aggressive:
Aggressive players thrive on high-risk, high-reward scenarios. They often make bold plays, seeking to dominate their opponents early and often. These players are likely to take the lead in initiating fights and pushing the tempo of the game. They may communicate frequently in chat and sometimes push the boundaries, resulting in chat restrictions or bans.

Patient:
Patient players prefer a more measured approach, focusing on long-term success rather than immediate gains. They often spend the early game farming and preparing for late-game dominance. These players are strategic and calculated, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. They usually avoid unnecessary conflicts and focus on objectives and efficient resource management.

**Physical/Magical**
Physical:
Physical damage champions typically rely on basic attacks and physical abilities to deal damage. Players who favor physical champions often enjoy mastering combos and precise attack patterns. They might gravitate towards melee fighters or marksmen who can dish out sustained damage through their physical prowess.

Magical:
Magical damage champions rely on spells and abilities that scale with magic power. Players who prefer magical champions enjoy the fantasy and strategy of casting powerful spells. They often have an affinity for mages or magical supports and may be drawn to the mystique of fantasy settings and characters.

**Leader/Follower**
Leader:
Leaders are players who take charge during the game, often directing their teamâ€™s movements and strategies. They are confident in initiating fights and making crucial decisions. Leaders are proactive in securing objectives and guiding their team to victory, often taking on the responsibility of making key plays.

Follower:
Followers prefer to support their team and follow the lead of others. They excel in roles that involve assisting teammates, such as healing, shielding, or providing utility. Followers are team-oriented and willing to sacrifice themselves for the greater good, prioritizing objectives and team success over personal glory.

**Melee/Ranged**
Melee:
Melee champions engage in close combat, often having to dive into the heart of the fight. Players who favor melee champions enjoy the intensity and directness of being in the thick of the action. They often play tanky or bruiser roles, capable of absorbing damage while dealing it up close.

Ranged:
Ranged champions attack from a distance, relying on positioning and kiting to deal damage while staying safe. Players who prefer ranged champions enjoy the challenge of maintaining optimal distance and leveraging their range advantage. They often play marksmen or ranged mages who can influence fights from afar.
